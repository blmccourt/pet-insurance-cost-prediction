# Pet Insurance Cost Prediction

## Problem Statement

Currently, the premium pricing process involves a combination of manual underwriting and rule-based methods, which may not fully account for the diverse factors influencing the cost of pet insurance.

This process can lead to inaccurate pricing, resulting in either overpriced premiums that deter potential customers or underpriced policies that increase risk for the insurer.

## Business Case

By developing a machine learning algorithm to predict pet health insurance premiums, companies can leverage historical data to produce more accurate, dynamic, and fair pricing models.

Key Benefits

- Improved pricing accuracy
- Increased customer retention and acquisition
- Operational efficiency
- Scalability

## Project Objective

Develop a machine learning algorithm capable of predicting pet insurance premiums with at least 80% R-squared accuracy, providing fair pricing for customers while optimizing profitability for the business.
